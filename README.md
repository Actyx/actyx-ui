## Simple, modular UI Components for Shop Floor Applications

Industrial UI is a React toolkit built by [Actyx](https://www.actyx.com), a German tech company specializing in [distributed edge computing for factories](https://www.actyx.com/products/os/). The toolkit features over 45 components and is mostly meant for building Shop Floor Applications that run in modern browsers on Rugged Industrial Tablets.

Industrial UI provides buttons, tabs, cards, navigation, and many other components, all of which have designed and tested to maximize operators' user experience and productivity in industrial environments. The project is "battle-tested" and running in production for Actyx's customers in seven countries.

Industrial UI is written entirely in TypeScript with predictable static types, making it easy to pick up and understand.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Industrial UI is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actyx/industrial-ui).
